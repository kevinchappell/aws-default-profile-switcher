# AWS Default Profile Switcher

A gnome extension to easily set a named profile as the default profile. Most CLI allows you to pass a `--profile` or `--aws-profile` argument however some do not. This extension was created to address tools and scripts that rely on a default profile and prevent developer mistakes when managing AWS with multiple profiles.

## Prerequisites
